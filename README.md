## Overview

VIDM Saml Toolkit is a simple Java SDK (software development kit) for web developers who want to implement “Sign In with VMware Identity Manager” for their web applications. 
VMware Identity Manager is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) offering, providing application provisioning, self-service catalog, conditional access controls and Single Sign-On (SSO) for SaaS, web, cloud and native mobile applications. For implementing SSO with vIDM, web developers should follow SAML 2.0 standard to encode SAML request and decode SAML response. It is not a small task without using any SAML library. 
This toolkit can save developers' effort by providing some easy to use functions. A web developer can implement SSO function with vIDM, even if he has no knowledge about SAML 2.0. This toolkit is platform independent, since it is written in Java. 
This Toolkit supports the following 4 functions:      
1, Initialize SSO service with vIDM URL      
2, Create an authentication request to vIDM      
3, Process an authentication result from vIDM      
4, Sign Out
